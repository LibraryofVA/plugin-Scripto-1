Scripto (plugin for Omeka)
==========================


Summary
-------

[Scripto](http://scripto.org/) is an open-source tool developed by [Center for History & New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/)
that allows collaborative transcription of digital files. Built on [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/)
Scripto is intended to be used as an extension of a content management system.
Scripto is currently available as a plugin for [Omeka](https://omeka.org/), Wordpress, and Drupal.


[The University of Iowa Libraries](http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/) created [ui-libraries/plugin-Scripto](https://github.com/ui-libraries/plugin-Scripto) a fork of CHNM's Scripto tool for crowdsourced transcription of documents. 
UI Libraries fork of plugin-Scripto was built for use with their [DIYHistory|transcribe](http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/transcribe/) project. Visit [DIYhistory|code](http://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/code.html) for an overview of the technology stack and implementation information. Visit [ui-libraries/plugin-Scripto](https://github.com/ui-libraries/plugin-Scripto) for details on features originally added by UI Libraries.

This fork is for use with the Library of Virginia's [Making History: Transcribe](https://github.com/LibraryofVA/MakingHistory-transcribe-2.0) project. 


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "Scripto".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.

The new fields for the Scripto element set will automatically be installed with
a fresh install of the fork [LibraryofVA/plugin-Scripto-2.0](https://github.com/LibraryofVA/plugin-Scripto-2.0).
